# scipy-articles
This repository is meant for storing and collaborating on publications about
SciPy written by the SciPy development team.

**Repo organization**: one independent directory per article.  Within that
directory should be placed:

- all article content (text, code, supporting data)
- tests for code if needed
- build scripts, style files, etc. to reproduce the complete article
- a README file to explain how to build the article and details on where it has
  been or will be submitted, who are the lead authors, etc.

**License**: all content in this repo is BSD-licensed.  Using the same license
as for SciPy itself helps in reusing code, documentation and text.
Some content may have to be dual-licensed to conform to journal requirements
(for example: The Journal of Open Source Software) mandates CC BY 4.0 for text
and MIT for code).  This will be made clear in the README of the article
itself.

**Governance**: decisions about content in this repository, and about which
articles to write in the first place, are made by the SciPy development team in
the same way as decisions about SciPy itself are made.

## Types of publications

At the moment we foresee writing two kinds of articles:

1. Traditional full-length articles (peer reviewed).
2. Abstract articles (peer reviewed).

An abstract article is a very brief article, aimed at providing a citable
peer-reviewed paper with minimal effort that allows contributors to get
academic credit for their work.  See http://joss.theoj.org/about for more
details on this.
