# scipy-articles
This repository is meant for storing and collaborating on publications about
SciPy written by the SciPy development team.

**Repo organization**: one independent directory per article.  Within that
directory should be placed:

- all article content (text, code, supporting data)
- tests for code if needed
- build scripts, style files, etc. to reproduce the complete article
- a README file to explain how to build the article and details on where it has
  been or will be submitted, who are the lead authors, etc.

**License**: all content in this repo is BSD-licensed.  Using the same license
as for SciPy itself helps in reusing code, documentation and text.

**Governance**: decisions about content in this repository, and about which
articles to write in the first place, are made by the SciPy development team in
the same way as decisions about SciPy itself are made.
