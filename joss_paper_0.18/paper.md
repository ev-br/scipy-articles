# Summary

SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics, science,
and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration,
linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers,
and more. 

The @SciPy library depends on @NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional
array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and
provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines
for numerical integration and optimization. 

The latest stable release of SciPy is [0.18.1](@SciPy0181), which improves on the feature
release [0.18.0](SciPy0180). Together they contain numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage,
better documentation and many new features. For the complete description of the
contents of the 0.18 series, see the [release notes](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/tag/v0.18.0).
